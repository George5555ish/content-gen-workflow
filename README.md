### CONTENT WORKFLOW FOR SCRIPT TO YT VIDEO

## Here's what I have so far in this repo: 

~ Personal Assistant (Doesn't really do much yet, but essentially I hope to make this work together with the telegram bot to work on the videos

~ Upload to Youtube: Best way I found is with upload-post.com. works better than looking for integrations that will take forever to test.

What's left is to sort out how the videos would be generated, where to store them and how to retreive them for youtube upload.

Cheers.
